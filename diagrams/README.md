## üõ†Ô∏è How to Generate Diagrams

### Option 1: Online PlantUML
1. Visit http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
2. Copy content from .puml files
3. Paste and generate

### Option 2: VS Code Extension
1. Install "PlantUML" extension
2. Open .puml files
3. Use Alt+D to preview

### Option 3: Command Line
```bash
# Install PlantUML
npm install -g node-plantuml

# Generate all diagrams
plantuml docs/diagrams/*.puml

# Generate specific diagram
plantuml docs/diagrams/use-case-diagram.puml
```

### Option 4: GitHub Integration
Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Generate PlantUML Diagrams
  uses: cloudbees/plantuml-github-action@master
  with:
    args: -v -tsvg docs/diagrams/*.puml
```

## üìù Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Include diagram type in filename
- Use .puml extension
- Keep titles consistent with document sections

## üîÑ Updates
When modifying diagrams:
1. Update the corresponding .puml file
2. Regenerate images if needed
3. Update documentation references
4. Commit both source and generated files
